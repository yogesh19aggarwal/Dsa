FOR LOOP

is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop than while or do-while loops.

initialize variable, check condition and increment/decrement value.

for(initialization; condition; incr/decr){    
//code to be executed    
}  

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main() {  
         for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){      
            cout<<i <<"\n";      
          }       
} 

Nested For Loop
use for loop inside another for loop, it is known as nested for loop
#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
   
int main () {  
        for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){      
             for(int j=1;j<=5;j++){      
            cout<<i<<" "<<j<<"\n";      
          }     
        }  
    }    

If we use double semicolon in for loop, it will be executed infinite times.
