Do-While loop

do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times
If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use do-while loop.

do-while loop is executed at least once because condition is checked after loop body

do{    
//code to be executed    
}while(condition);  

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main() {  
     int i = 1;    
          do{    
              cout<<i<<"\n";    
              i++;    
          } while (i <= 5) ;    
}  

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main() {  
     int i = 1;    
         do{    
              int j = 1;          
              do{    
                cout<<i; 
                cout<<j<<"\n";       
                  j++;    
              } while (j <= 3) ;    
              i++;    
          } while (i <= 3) ;     
}  

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main() {  
      do{    
              cout<<"Infinitive do-while Loop";    
          } while(true);     
}
