Variable
A variable is a name of memory location( container). It is a way to represent memory location through symbol so that it can be easily identified. Its value can be changed and it can be reused many times.

type variable_name;   

int age;    
float marks;    
char a;  

Rules for defining variables
A variable name can contain alphabets, digits and underscore but variable name can start with alphabet and underscore only. It can't start with digit.
No white space is allowed within variable name.
A variable name must not be any reserved word or keyword e.g. char, float etc.



1. Local Variables
Local variables are declared inside the function
it must be declared before they have used in the program

int main()
{
   int x = 2; //local variable
}

2. Global Variables
Global variables are declared outside the functions. Any functions i.e. both local function and global function can change the value of global variables.

int y = 10; //global variable
int main()
{
   int x = 5; //local variable
}

3. Static Variables
These variables are declared with the word static.

int main()
{
   int x = 5; //local variable
   static y = 2; //static variable
}

4. Automatic Variables
Automatic variables are declared with the auto keyword. All the variables that are declared inside the functions are default considered as an automatic variable.

int main()
{
   int x = 20; //local variable (Automatic variable)
   auto int y = 12; //automatic variable
}

5. External Variables
By using the extern keyword, external variables are declared.

extern int x=1;//external variable (also global) 

#include "myfile.cpp"  
#include <iostream>  
void printValue(){  
    cout<<x;  
}
