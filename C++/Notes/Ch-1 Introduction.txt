FEATURES OF C++
->Simple(bcoz it provides structured approach)
->Abstract Data types(Abstract Data Type(ADT) is a data type, where only behavior is defined but not implementation)
->Portable( Machine Independent)
->Mid-level programming language( bcoz it binds the low-level & high-level programming language)
->Rich Library( provide a lot of inbuilt functions that make the development fast)
->Memory Management( various memory management operators to save memory and improve the program's efficiency)
->Pointers( can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers)
->Recursion( can call the function within the function)
->Object-Oriented( it makes development and maintenance easier)
->Compiler based( first, need to compile using a compiler and then execution)
->Reusability( as the existing code can be reused)
->Errors are easily detected( provide a feature called exception handling)
->Strongly typed language( funtion call is typed checked during compilation)
->Redefine Existing Operators( to redefine the meaning of existing operators)
