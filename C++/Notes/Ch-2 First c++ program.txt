FIRST C++ PROGRAM

#include <iostream.h>  
#include<conio.h>  
int main() {  
   clrscr();  
   cout << "Hello World";   
   return 0;
   getch();  
}  

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
     cout<<"Hello World";
     return 0;
}

#include<iostream> includes the standard input output library functions. It provides cin and cout methods for reading from input and writing to output.

#include <conio> includes the console input output library functions. The getch() function is defined in conio.h file.

Using namespace std is because computer needs to know the code for the cout, cin functionalities and it needs to know which namespace they are defined.

int main() The main() function is the entry point of every program in C++ language. The int keyword specifies that it returns no value.

clrscr() function is used to clear the console screen.

cout << "Hello World" is used to print the data on the console.

getch() The getch() function asks for a single character. Until you press any key, it blocks the screen.

C++ Basic Input/Output
I/O operation is using the stream concept. Stream is the sequence of bytes or flow of data. It makes the performance fast.

If bytes flow from main memory to device like printer, display screen, or a network connection, etc, this is called as output operation.

If bytes flow from device like printer, display screen, or a network connection, etc to main memory, this is called as input operation.

<iostream>	
It is used to define the cout, cin and cerr objects, which correspond to standard output stream, standard input stream and standard error stream.

Standard output stream (cout)
The cout is a predefined object of ostream class. It is connected with the standard output device, which is usually a display screen. The cout is used in conjunction with stream insertion operator (<<) to display the output on a console

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main( ) {  
   int num = 21;  
   cout << "Value of num is: " << num << endl;  
} 

Standard input stream (cin)
The cin is a predefined object of istream class. It is connected with the standard input device, which is usually a keyboard. The cin is used in conjunction with stream extraction operator (>>) to read the input from a console.

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main( ) {  
  int age;  
   cout << "Enter your age: ";  
   cin >> age;  
   cout << "Your age is: " << age << endl;  
}  

Standard end line (endl)
The endl is a predefined object of ostream class. It is used to insert a new line characters and flushes the stream.

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main( ) {  
cout << "C++";     
cout << "code"<<endl;   
cout << "End of line"<<endl;   
}
