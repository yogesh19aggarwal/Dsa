C++ COMMENTS

statements that are not executed by the compiler
used to provide explanation of the code, variable, method or class

are two types of comments in C++.

Single Line comment (//)
Multi Line comment (/∗ ..... ∗/)

#include <iostream>  
using namespace std;  
int main()  
{  
/* Multiline
comment */   
 int x = 16;   // x is a variable    
 cout<<x<<"\n";         
}
